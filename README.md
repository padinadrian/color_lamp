# Color Lamp


Just a pet project I made to add bluetooth to a remote-controller color-changing LED light. Originally the light was controlled by an IR remote but I wanted to hang it from outside my office and control the color from my phone.

For the BTLE control I used an [Adafruit Feather Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062) and reverse-engineered the IR receiver signal to replicate it using a regular GPIO pin.

This project will be pretty spare on documentation because it was just a quick fun project. If you have any questions you can email me directly.
